# flutter_cleaner

This Flutter app for macOS lists all build folders with their size. 
Build folders can grow above 500 MB up to 1 GB!
It's easy to delete all selected folders to make space on the disk.


## Getting started
Create your own version if you have Flutter installed on macOS anyway.

```
git clone github.com/schilken/flutter_cleaner
flutter pub get
flutter build macos
```
You find the built app here: `flutter_cleaner/build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Flutter Cleaner`

## Download a release from github
(coming soon)

## Making of this app or similar tools
